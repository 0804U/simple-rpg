#### A Simple HTML5/JavaScript/Phaser RPG engine #####


## Description

I wanted an easy to use html5 engine to create small adventure games. The idea is to release very tiny secions of a game similar to a web video series or web comic.
Each individual game should stand alone and be fun but also have some branching story.

I remember playing the original Fallout's demo over and over. 
[Fallout Demo wikia](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_Demo) Instead of creating a massive game all at once, the idea is to release smaller stories over time.

## Features
- Multiple map types: isometric, top down and the hex system used in Fallout 1 [Demo](http://swarmherdflock.com/games/RPG/RPG_Old1/index.html)
- State machine to handle both turn and real-time combat
- Waypoint system for moving NPC on set paths.
- Event system 
- Dialog system for branching stories

## Notes

The editor is actually written in Unity3D. Unfortunately it uses some Unity Store components so it cannot be opensourced yet. I am working on a new editor. That I will put in this space as well.

Pathfinding is done by easystarjs. With Some minor customizations.
